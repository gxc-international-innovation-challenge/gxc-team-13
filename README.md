# Ecolution
Our team created Ecolution - an online platform that works with ECOPROFIT.\
Ecolution is intended to popularize the idea of being an ecologically responsible business. \
We aim to motivate, inspire, and connect the companies that want to reduce CO2. Ecolution helps the ECOPROFIT program to support existing members, and engage new businesses. \
Every company gets access to a personal profile as well as graphs for visualizing their CO2 data. \
They can collaborates with other companies, get advices and individual measures from ECOPROFIT program. \
Based on their progress, businesses will be awarded an ecolution label to promote more consumer support for environmentally responsible businesses.

# The core freatures
The core features of Ecolution are to provide a stronger network of companies for information sharing through our network, to assign an EcoLabel system to boost companies' social image, and to provide easier carbon emissions tracking.\
With these features in mind, we decided to use a sticky sidebar that allows for easy movement between the core features as well as a sticky header. \
The updated sticky sidebar includes tabs with reworked names and consistent icons: Dashboard, Graphs, Input Forms, News Feed, Participants, EcoLabels, Ecoprofit, and My Messages.\
The user can also access their company profile, settings, and logout button.

## Carbon Tracking

Ecolution provides user-friendly graphs that are available through the dashboard. The inputted carbon data from the companies are used to generate user-friendly graphs to motivate companies to continue on their journey to carbon neutrality.

The EcoLabel is assigned to companies based on their progress to carbon neutrality. There are four tiers: 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% to carbon neutrality. This is available to the users as well as the public. In Sprint 2, more EcoLabels were added along with information on what each Ecolabel stands for. This information is public available and can be accessed through the menu option under About. There are currently three categories of EcoLabels.
