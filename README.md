## Solution
Ecolution is an online platform that centralizes the tools for reducing carbon emissions. Participants can track their carbon emissions, visualize their progress, and boost their image as an environmentally responsible businesses all in one application. Ecolutions aims to provide a stronger community of businesses working together to reduce industry carbon emission. The website makes it easier for users to interact and collaborates with other businesses with its direct chat functions and newsfeed as well as share information about their implemented measures. To motivate businesses more, Ecolution also provide an EcoLabel system that provides consumer more information and helps close the attitude-behavior gap of envionrmental conscious citizens. 

### Visualization

Ecolution provides user-friendly graphs that are available through the dashboard. The inputted carbon data from the companies are used to generate user-friendly graphs to motivate companies to continue on their journey to carbon neutrality.





### Visibility
To close the attitide-behavior gap of consumers, Ecolution provides more visibility through the _Participants_ page and the Ecolabels. Consumers and other businesses can search up companies based on their name, size, and industry as well as locate their headquarters with the map function. The Ecolution EcoLabels is designed to give more information for consumers and are divided into the following categories: 

% to Carbon Neutrality     |  Ecolution Leader             | Registered Participants        |

## Process
- **Research:** Research: To understand the scope of our challenge, we research existing measures for the current problem, ecological data, and verified statistics relevant to the problem. This narrowed our path to finding a viable solution for the City of Munich. More research was indulged in about Eco-Profit in order to utilize its full potential as well. 
     >  _**More details in [Research](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-13/wiki/Research) and [Interview](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-13/wiki/Interviews).**_
- **Ideation:**    <img align="right" src="Storyboard_V2.JPG" width="300" height="250">
To synthesize our research, our team created an [Empathy Map]() to set our core values clear among the team members. Using the empathy map, we brainstormed ideas and voted for the idea we wanted. A draft storyboard was created to display our solution idea before it was further developed with the help of feedback. Then a press release and a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) were created to help the team think about what needs to be achieved with our prototype.

- **Prototype:** The [first prototype](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-13/wiki/Version-1-Prototype) was created and demoed with businesses and consumers. The demo test provided feedback on how to improve our prototype. Based on the feedback, the [second prototype](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-13/wiki/Version-2-Prototype) improved its user-friendliness, added more clear definitions, and streamlined our core features. 
     >  _**For instructions on how to use the Prototype, click [here](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-13/wiki/Prototype).**_
     
- **Business Model**: Creating a [Business Model](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-13/wiki/Business-Model-Canvas) canvas, helped us identify how to make our pitch sustainable and more appealing.
