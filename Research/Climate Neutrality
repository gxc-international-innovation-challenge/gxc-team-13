## Munich's current science based approach for Climate Neutrality 
Munich, which, also starting from a science-based
approach, sets a seemingly more ambitious neutrality target for 2050, that of 0.3 tonnes CO2eq. per
capita and year, in an effort to align as much as feasible (given the level of political enforceability) with
the threshold of 1.5°C (with 66% probability)
It is, however, important to first attempt to reach a more global consensus on a set
of minimum information (including the system boundaries, the offsetting methods and limitations, etc.)
to be reported in the future when municipal climate protection concepts are published. In the medium
term, the development of a standard leaving adequate leeway for adaptation to the local situation, while
supporting a transparent declaration of used methods and system boundaries and providing a basic
typology of cities is possible. The profiles indicators according to **ISO 37120** [38] already provide a
good basis for the latter; the definition of cities’ profiles for the purpose of fairer cross-city comparisons.
In this sense, this topic cannot yet be considered as completed and further investigation and
discussion is needed.
